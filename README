Example input string:

"disk=/&tcp=localhost:22&sa=&st=yves.junqueira%40gmail.com&sf=root%40cetico.org"

This creates a prober that checks if port 22 is reachable and if the root
filesystem has enough space, sending an email in case of problems.

Example user crontab:

@hourly nohup /home/nictuku/bin/obamad "disk=/&tcp=localhost:22&sa=&st=yves.junqueira\%40gmail.com&sf=root\%40cetico.org" &

Notes on using it with crontab:
- it doesn't use special privileges
- the % symbols must be escaped by \
- it will silently exit if another copy of obamad is already running
- it's configured to run @hourly just in case it unexpectedly crashes -
  strictly speaking, @reboot should be enough.
